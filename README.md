The Pet Store company wants to build the back-end for its e-commerce to offer pets adoption. Will exist 3 principal modules: Pet, Store, and User.

Project Status: In process.

To make sure that everything goes ok, for the exploratory test you need to have installed Postman tool and run this Json file, also you need to configurate a global or collection variable that contains the API base url (https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json).
